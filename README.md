# My Technical Interview Training Repository

Welcome to my technical interview training repository!

This repository is dedicated to solving problems commonly asked in technical computer science interviews. My goal here is to share my solutions and learn through discussing alternative approaches.

## Contents

The content of this repository mainly consists of solutions to problems from popular online training platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, among others. Each problem is accompanied by a problem description, a Python-coded solution, and in most cases, tests and a performance analysis of the solution.

## Contributions

Your comments, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue to discuss a solution or propose a pull request with your own solutions.

## Disclaimer

Please note that using these solutions for purposes other than personal learning may constitute a violation of the terms of use of the coding platforms mentioned. Use these solutions for personal learning and training purposes only.
